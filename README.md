## üåü Project Overview

This project delves into the first 1000 website visits to uncover key patterns in customer behavior. By analyzing referral sources, user drop-off points, ad interactions, and device preferences, the goal is to pinpoint the specific actions, channels, and attributes that lead to successful sales.

## ‚ú® Key Insights & Discoveries

Our analysis revealed several critical aspects of customer behavior:

* **Total Customers:** 371
* **Total Website Visits:** 1,000
* **Completed Purchases:** 106
* **Average Visit Duration:** 4.15 minutes

### üìä Customer Behavior Highlights:

* **Referral Traffic Domination:** Instagram drives the highest user traffic, outperforming Facebook and Google combined. This highlights the power of social media in attracting both new and returning visitors.
* **Critical Exit Pages:** Most users exit on the product and checkout pages, highlighting friction points early in the funnel. This indicates potential usability or trust issues in the purchase flow.
* **Conversion Drop-Off:** A significant conversion drop-off is visible in the purchase funnel:
    * 418 users added items to their cart
    * Only 359 proceeded to checkout
    * Just 106 completed their purchase
    * Merely 17 left feedback
    * This emphasizes the urgent need for checkout optimization.
* **Strong Ad Engagement:** Most users did interact with ads, reflecting successful ad engagement and strong brand visibility in promotional channels.
* **Mobile-First Audience:** Most users access the site via mobile devices, underlining the importance of a seamless mobile experience.

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

Based on our findings, we propose the following actionable strategies to enhance the customer journey and boost sales:

* **Combat Cart Abandonment:** Implement Exit-Intent Popups or Recovery Emails: Use prompts or cart recovery strategies to re-engage users who drop off during checkout.
* **Optimize Conversion Funnel:** Optimize Checkout and Product Pages: Simplify design, enhance clarity, and highlight key information to build trust and guide users through the purchase flow.
* **Incentivize Feedback:** Encourage Post-Purchase Feedback: Make feedback easy and incentivized to increase response rate and gain insight into any friction points.
* **Enhance Mobile Experience:** Given the high mobile usage, continuously optimize the website for mobile devices to ensure a flawless and intuitive user experience.

## üìà The Customer Journey Map

Our analysis is framed around the five stages of the customer journey:

1.  **Awareness:** Customers commonly discover the brand through social media platforms and online ads, which effectively attract both new and returning visitors to the website.
2.  **Consideration:** Once they arrive, users often explore product categories like casual wear. High engagement is observed among younger customers who spend time Browse and comparing options.
3.  **Purchase:** Shoppers are more likely to complete a purchase if they've visited before, interacted with promotions, or experienced a smooth and quick checkout process.
4.  **Retention:** Customers who were satisfied with their first purchase tend to return. Repeat purchases are especially frequent among those who bought trending or seasonal items.
5.  **Advocacy:** Satisfied customers often share their experiences through reviews or by returning to shop again. Their behavior supports brand trust and influences new shoppers.
